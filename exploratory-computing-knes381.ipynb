Selecting descriptive names aids in understanding the code. Variable names cannot have spaces, nor can they start with a number. And variable names are case sensitive. So the variable `myvariable` is not the same as the variable `MyVariable`. The name of a variable may be anything you want, except for reserved words in the Python language. For example, it is not possible to create a variable `for = 7`, as `for` is a reserved word. You will learn many of the reserved words when we continue; they are colored bold green when you type them in the Notebook.\n\n## Basic plotting and a first array\nPlotting is not part of standard Python, but a nice package exists to create pretty graphics (and ugly ones, if you want). A package is a library of functions for a specific set of tasks. There are many Python packages and we will use several of them. The graphics package we use is called `matplotlib`. To be able to use the plotting functions in `matplotlib`, we have to import it. We will learn several different ways of importing packages.

This is actually a handle to the line that is created with the last command in the code block (in this case `plt.plot(intensity, vo2)`). Remember: the result of the last line in a code cell is printed to the screen, unless it is stored in a variable. You can tell the Notebook not to print this to the screen by putting a semicolon after the last command in the code block (so type `plot(intensity, vo2);`).\n\nThe `plot` function can take many arguments. Looking at the help box of the `plot` function, by typing `plt.plot(` and then shift-tab, gives you a lot of help. Typing `plt.plot?` gives a new scrollable subwindow at the bottom of the notebook, showing the documentation on `plot`. Click the x in the upper right hand corner to close the subwindow again.\n\nIn short, `plot` can be used with one argument as `plot(y)`, which plots `y` values along the vertical axis and enumerates the horizontal axis starting at 0. `plot(x, y)` plots `y` vs `x`, and `plot(x, y, formatstring)` plots `y` vs `x` using colors and markers defined in `formatstring`, which can be a lot of things. It can be used to define the color, for example `'b'` for blue, `'r'` for red, and `'g'` for green. Or it can be used to define the linetype `'-'` for line, `'--'` for dashed, `':'` for dots. Or you can define markers, for example `'o'` for circles and `'s'` for squares. You can even combine them: `'r--'` gives a red dashed line, while `'go'` gives green circular markers.\n\nIf that isn't enough, `plot` takes a large number of keyword arguments.
